# MechaCar_Analysis

## Linear Regression ##

The Dataset has 6 coefficients and the line helps identify them in the data set.

In the summary of the linear regression we see the content of the dataset, so the min., median, and max is shown. The coefficients are shown too to determine the content.

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The P-value that the summary displayed is compared to alpha = .05, to see if it is significant. Vehicle length and ground clearance variables represent non-random amounts of variance as applied to the mpg values.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The scientific notion has to be converted and once it is converted we see that non of the coefficents are zero.
Coefficients:

vehicle length: 6.267

vehicle weight: .001

spoiler angle: .069

ground clearance: 3.546

AWD: -3.411


Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-squared is .7149, and r-squared is the regression error metric to justify the performace and thr r-squared is closer to one than zero.
